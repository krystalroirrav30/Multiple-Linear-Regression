# Multiple Linear Regression Model for Predicting Highway Miles-Per-Gallon

## Overview

This document provides an in-depth explanation of the Multiple Linear Regression model implemented in the Jupyter Notebook. The model aims to predict highway miles-per-gallon (MPG) based on various vehicle characteristics. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this study is cars.csv, containing various features of cars. The model predicts the highway MPG based on multiple independent variables.

### Features:

Various vehicle characteristics (e.g., engine size, weight, horsepower)

Target Variable: highway MPG

## Requirements

To execute this analysis, install the following dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels

### Libraries Used:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis

numpy: For numerical operations

matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization

scikit-learn: For model training and evaluation

statsmodels: For statistical analysis

## Steps to Run the Notebook

Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>

Navigate to the project directory:

cd <repository-folder>

Ensure the cars.csv dataset is present in the directory.

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Open Multiple_Linear_Regression.ipynb and execute the cells step-by-step.

## Model Training & Evaluation

Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split().

Regression Model: A LinearRegression model is trained using scikit-learn.

Performance Metrics:

R² Score: Measures the goodness of fit

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the absolute difference between actual and predicted values

Multicollinearity Check: Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is used to detect multicollinearity among independent variables.

## Results & Interpretation

Model Performance: The model achieves a reasonable R² score, indicating that it effectively explains the variance in highway MPG.

Feature Importance: Some independent variables, such as engine size and weight, significantly impact the prediction of highway MPG.

Visualization Insights: Correlation heatmaps show strong relationships between specific features and highway MPG, confirming expected trends in automotive efficiency.

Error Analysis: Residual plots indicate that the model assumptions hold well, with minimal heteroscedasticity.

## What Makes This Model Stand Out?

Feature Engineering: The inclusion of multicollinearity checks using VIF enhances model robustness.

Comprehensive Evaluation: The model is assessed using multiple metrics, ensuring reliable predictions.

Visualization-Driven Insights: The use of scatter plots, heatmaps, and residual analysis helps in better understanding the data trends.
